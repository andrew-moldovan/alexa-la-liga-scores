To run locally
```
npm install -g node-lambda
```
Then run this command
```
node-lambda run
```
This will run the event in event.json through the code. This is copy pasted from the amazon developer Service Simulator

To run a specific event file instead of the default one
```
node-lambda run -j help-event.json
```
